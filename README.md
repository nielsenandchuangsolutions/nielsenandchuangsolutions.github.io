This website is where you can find our (Arnab Adhikary and [Rio Weil](https://rioweil.github.io)) solutions manual to Nielsen and Chuang's "Quantum Computation and Quantum Information" textbook, the bible of QC/QI. We have attempted to make the presentation pedagogical, and have included all of the exercise/problems statements as well as the necessary concepts involved for each.

Find Volume 1 of our solutions manual here: (TODO)

This volume focuses on physical aspects of quantum computation, and contains solutions to all exercises/problems in Chapters 2 (Introduction to quantum mechanics), 4 (Quantum circuits), 7 (Quantum computers: physical realization), 8 (Quantum noise and quantum operations), 9 (Distance measures for quantum information), and 10 (Quantum error-correction).

Volume 2 (Chapters 1, 3, 5-6, 11-12, Appendices) is in progress. Some scattered solutions are here: (TODO)
